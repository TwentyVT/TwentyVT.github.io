                        <p>My name's Jake. I'm currently a QA Engineer working on web/mobile web products. I have a unique story in that I started out my journey in the tech industry as a recruiter. It's not a glorious job, and can get quite boring and tedious. I wanted something more challenging. In 2016, while working at Audible, I recruiter the web QA team. Eventually, they had an entry level position availabl, and in my weekly recruiting meeting with the manager, I expressed interest. She gave me a shot, and allowed me to interview. Two years later, and it's been a blast. I knew I always wanted to work in tech, and I'm happy I got my chance. I'm really excited for this bootcamp and how much more I can learn.
